# Developing Solutions for Microsoft Teams

This repository contains the supporting files for the short course Developing Solutions on Microsoft Teams.

## Course Setup

Prior to the course, it's recommended to have the following set up on your computer:

* Node.js
* Visual Studio Code
* Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code
* Recommended: Git source control

In addition, you will need to be able to use Microsoft Teams, which means that you need a Microsoft 365 tenant. Any kind of trial or development tenant is fine, but it's not recommended to use a production tenant. If you don't have one already, you can join the Microsoft 365 Development Program. You'll also need a Microsoft Account to do this and again, if you don't have one you can very quickly create one.

In addition to Windows, these instructions should apply to Linux and MacOS, although I haven't tested them on these operating systems.

### Create a Microsoft Account:

In a private browser window, go to http://outlook.com/. You need to use an in-private browser window in case you already have an identity cached in your browser which stop you getting the "sign up" page).

### Join the MicrosoftÂ 365 Developer Program:

In a browser, go to https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program and sign up using the Microsoft Account you created in the previous step.

### Install Node.js

Go to https://nodejs.org/. There will be a link to the LTS (long-term support) version for your operating system, but at the time of writing only versions 12 and 14 of node.js are supported. Instead of the LTS version, go to the "other downloads" page. From there, find the Previous Releases link, and on the following page, type "Node.js 14" into the search box to find the *latest* v14 LTS release (probably 14.19). On the downloads page, choose the file for your operating system, e.g. node-v14.19.1-x64.msi for Windows.

### Install Visual Studio Code

Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ and click on the link to install Visual Studio Code (not Visual Studio) and follow the instructions.

### Install the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

Open Visual Studio Code, select the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or View > Extensions). In the search box, enter Teams Toolkit, then click on the green install button next to Teams Toolkit.

### Install the Git source control system

Go to https://git-scm.com/. There should be a link on the home page to install for your operating system.
