# Developing Solutions for Microsoft Teams

This repository contains the supporting files for the short course Developing Solutions on Microsoft Teams.

## Course Setup

Prior to the course, it's recommended to have the following set up on your computer:

* Node.js
* Visual Studio Code
* Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

In addition, you will need to be able to use Microsoft Teams, which means that you need a Microsoft 365 tenant. Any kind of trial or development tenant is fine, but it's not recommended to use a production tenant. If you don't have one already, you can join the Microsoft 365 Development Program. You'll also need a Microsoft Account to do this and again, if you don't have one you can very quickly create one.

### Create a Microsoft Account:

In a private browser window, go to http://outlook.com/. You need to use an in-private browser window in case you already have an identity cached in your browser which stop you getting the "sign up" page).

### Join the MicrosoftÂ 365 Developer Program:

In a browser, go to https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program and sign up using the Microsoft Account you created in the previous step.
